        * [ ] Implement **anomaly detection** using IQR, z-score, or rolling MAD.

        ---

        #### **4. Forecast Module (ARIMA & SARIMA)**

        * [ ] Implement **grid search** for ARIMA/SARIMA parameters:

        * Search over $(p, d, q)$ and seasonal $(P, D, Q, m)$.
        * Filter out non-stationary configurations automatically.
        * [ ] Display **AIC/BIC comparison table** for all fitted models.
        * [ ] Add **residual diagnostics** using tools from the Explore module.
        * [ ] Include **forecast accuracy metrics** (MAE, RMSE, MAPE).
        * [ ] Enable **user selection of forecast horizon** (number of steps ahead).
        * [ ] Add **Plotly-based forecast plot** with shaded confidence intervals.
        * [ ] **Note:** (S)ARMA models assume stationarity; differencing or detrending may be required.

        ---

        #### **6. Auto-Forecast Module**

        A fully automated forecasting system that tests, compares, and selects the best model.

        * [ ] Develop an **automated model selection engine**:

        * Compare ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, ETS, and na√Øve baseline models.
        * Rank models based on AIC/BIC and validation metrics (MAPE, RMSE).
        * [ ] Include **automatic stationarity detection and transformation**:

        * Differencing, log-scaling, Box‚ÄìCox transformations if required.
        * [ ] Automate **train/test splitting** (e.g., last 20% of data for validation).
        * [ ] Add a **model comparison dashboard**:

        * Display ranked results with metrics and residual diagnostics.

# These are future featres i will implement later. Help me rewrite these soi can later implement them

# Need to note in forecast.py that note that (S)ARMA models need stationarity

# in explore.py add a rolling mean plot in explore # - We can also look at the rolling mean and std.

# In transform.py couuld remove seasonal differencing

# In explore.py do residual analysis
# - The residuals should approximate a Gaussian distribution (aka white noise).
# - Visual inspection:
#     - ACF plot.: auto cor in residuals: expect no correlations 
#     - Histogram.
#     - QQ plot. =# # - White noise should ideally follow a normal distribution.
# - Statistical tests:
#     - Normality.
# - &#x2705; Histogram/Density plot.
# - ü§î QQ-plot
# - &#x274C; Jarque-Bera (reliable for large sample size).
# - &#x274C; Shapiro-Wilk (reliable for large sample size).
#     - Autocorrelation.
#     - Heteroskedasticity.

# grid search for ARIMA and SARIMA with the ability to select
# Filter out non-stationary candidates
# evalauation metrics AIC, BIC, MAPE, RMSE
